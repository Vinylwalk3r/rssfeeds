# rssfeeds
My collection of RSS feeds saved into categories for Dynamic OPML import

I set these up in FreshRSS and you can easily import them by logging into your FreshRSS and then going to "Subscription Management" -> "Add feed or category" and choosing "Add dynamic OPML". Then you name your category and point it to any of my collections here.




(I don't know how set it up in any other RSS aggregator other than FreshRSS)
